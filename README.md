# BAPTrack
A novel multimodal object tracking framework based on bi-directional attention prompt learning.

Our proposed framework is able to take full advantage of the powerful ability of pre-trained foundation models to mine the complementarity between bi-modal features through bidirectional prompting, thus coping with complex scenes.

The code will be released after the paper is accepted.
